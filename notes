Arima temp model
"for every 1 ppm increase, the temp goes up by 0.0109 C"

Arima ppm model
"For every gigaton of emissions, ppm goes up by 0.0585"

(10559.408 * 3.664 * 1e6) / 1e9 
("Territorial emissions in Gt")

1.251 * 3.664 
("Land use contribution in Gt")


"General notes for arima
- some sort of lag with co2
- log transformation
- some version of nino/enso/smoothed enso
- seasonal diff
- no non-seasonal diff
"


# ------ Next Steps ------- #

- more advanced modeling with XGBoost and NNETAR
- Modeling uncertainty with current setup by generating different pathways for co2_ppm, computing the xregs for each .rep, modeling, then get quantiles (gpt thread)
- Use bagging to train models on different versions of the data
